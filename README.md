# Yet another Chip-8 emulator

Chip-8 is a low-level, interpreted programming language made in the mid-1970s by Joseph Weisbecker. Its original purpose was to facilitate game development for the COSMAC VIP and Telmac 1800 computers. Today, despite both of these having long become obsolete, Chip-8 remains relevant for its simplicity and low-level nature. Building an emulator (or, more accuratelly, a virtual machine) capable of running it is considered to be kind of the "Hello, World" of emulation. You can find out more about this language [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8).

This particular emulator is a work in progress, and it doesn't yet support all of Chip-8's instruction set.

# Thanks

Without Tobias V. Langhoff's [comprehensive guide](https://tobiasvl.github.io/blog/write-a-chip-8-emulator/) on Chip-8 emulation, this emulator would not have left the paper. Check it out if you're interested in this sort of thing.
