# Yet another Chip-8 emulator

Chip-8 is a low-level, interpreted programming language made in the mid-1970s by Joseph Weisbecker. Its original purpose was to facilitate game development for the COSMAC VIP and Telmac 1800 computers. Today, despite both of these having long become obsolete, Chip-8 remains relevant for its simplicity and low-level nature. Building an emulator (or, more accuratelly, an interpreter) capable of running it is considered to be kind of the "Hello, World" of emulation. You can find out more about this language [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8).

# Thanks

Without Tobias V. Langhoff's [comprehensive guide](https://tobiasvl.github.io/blog/write-a-chip-8-emulator/) on Chip-8 emulation, this emulator would not have left the paper. Check it out if you're interested in this sort of thing, it is really good. I also made sporadic use of Cowgod's [technical reference](http://devernay.free.fr/hacks/chip8/C8TECH10.HTM), which is also very complete and well-written.
